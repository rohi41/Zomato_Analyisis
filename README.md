# Zomato Restaurant Analysis
I have built dashboard in Power BI to analyze Zomato data, providing insights into popular cuisines, restaurant ratings, menu pricing, and customer behavior. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, the project aims to help restaurant owners, investors, and other stakeholders make data-driven decisions that improve profitability and success.


# Problem Statement
Zomato is a popular food delivery platform with a massive database of restaurants, ratings, reviews, menus, and more. However, with so much data available, it can be challenging to extract valuable insights and make informed business decisions. Our project aims to leverage Power BI's data modeling and visualization capabilities to analyze Zomato data and provide actionable insights to restaurant owners, investors, and other stakeholders in the food industry.
